# random-password-generator
This program generates random passwords(using the random function, don't use this when high security is required) with an unlimited length(that you can type in the entry). You can choose if the password should have numbers, text, and special characters by clicking the checkboxes(any combination works). If the generated password doesn't fit, resize the window or copy the password from the terminal. Required package: Tkinter
